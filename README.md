# Evaluating GPU-accelerated spatial data structures and boid-based obstacle avoidance
![alt text](Assets/Images/Voxelized_original_scene.png)

This study builds on top of Sebastian Lague's implementation of the Boid algorithm, and Garrett Gunnell's (Acerola) GPU voxel grid.
The purpose of this study is continue on Sebatian's future work ideas on accelerating the obstacle avoidance using spatial data stuctures.
This is an **DM2904 Individual Curse in Media Technology** for M's program at *KTH* ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª.

### Key Sections
- [Session Notes](session_notes.md): Detailed breakdowns of what is implemented, code explanations, and research questions (very geek-stuff).

## Original Work: Sebastian's Boids:

A little experiment with boids in Unity:

For a much better implemented and performant version in Unity, have a look at the ECS sample project:

## Original Work: Acerola's Counter Strike 2 Smoke Grenades

This is the code associated with my video explaining the implementation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryB8hT5TMSg&ab_channel=Acerola)
