# Evaluating GPU-accelerated spatial data structures and boid-based obstacle avoidance

This study builds on top of Sebastian Lague's implementation of the Boid algorithm, and Garrett Gunnell's (Acerola) GPU voxel grid.

The purpose of this study is continue on Sebatian's future work ideas on accelerating the obstacle avoidance using spatial data stuctures.

# Original Work: Acerola's Counter Strike 2 Smoke Grenades

This is the code associated with my video explaining the implementation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryB8hT5TMSg&ab_channel=Acerola)

# Original Work: Sebastian's Boids:

A little experiment with boids in Unity:

For a much better implemented and performant version in Unity, have a look at the ECS sample project:
