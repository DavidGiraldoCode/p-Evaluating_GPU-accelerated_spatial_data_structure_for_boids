# Session notes

## Session 2024-11-9: Breakdown of the code

**Objectives:** Identify and be able to answer
- What the entry point?
- How is the communication between the CPU and the GPU being handle? (Back and forward)
- How are they handling obstacle avoidance?
- Whats the breaking point of the system in terms of number of boids?
- What/where is the potential bottle neck?

### Entry points:
- Spwner, then boid, then manager

### CPU - GPU
- BoidManager prepares a buffer with a copy of all boids and sends to the GPU
- BoidCompute computes neighbours and accumulators
- BoidManager reads back and passes accumulator to each boid
- Each boid updates the steering forces

### Obstacle avoidance
- Sphere Casting along a ray, physics engine. Is casts 300 rays in front. Potential complexity is $$O(r*m)$$ where $$r$$ are the ray and $$m$$ the colliders to check for
- This is a potential bottle neck as it might have a time complexity of $$O(n*r*m)$$ where $$n$$ are the boids.

### Evaluation
$$n$$ Boids count, without collision avoidance. (The boids flew away, as expected)

| $$n$$ |   fps     |
|    --:|        --:|
| 100   |   ~450    |
| 1000  |   ~150    |
| 10000 |    ~15    |

$$n$$ Boids count, with Sebastian's CPU collision avoidance, no spatial data structure.

| $$n$$ |   fps     |
|    --:|        --:|
| 100   |   ~250    |
| 1000  |   ~100    |
| 10000 |     ~9    |

Obstacle avoidance is definitely a bottleneck.

*Boid-based obstacle avoidance, "ObstacleProbe"*
Baseline 6 colliders as walls.

$$n$$ Boids count, with 60 boid-based obstacle probes in CPU, 1920x1080
Many Boid leaks (not memory leaks, tho, XD) can be seen at $$n = 1000$$.

$$n$$ Boids count, with 60 manually placed boid-based obstacle probes, computing forces in GPU, no spatial data structure 

| $$n$$ |   fps     |
|    --:|        --:|
| 100   |   ~ 285   |
| 1000  |    ~ 50   |
| 10000 |     ~ 2   |

### Updates - Adding Voxelization

- Added Acerola's voxelizer to the scene.

#### Next Steps:
- Use the positions of the voxels as static boids to create obstacles.
- Implement spatial hashing

## Session 2024-11-10: Hashing obstacles at build time

**Objective and questions:** Spatially hash the obstacle probes and shade the voxels by the number of obstacles they contain.
- Where is the hash table stored?
- How many supporting data structures do we need to book-keep the obstacles?
- What needs to be sent to the GPU, and how many times?

### üìå IMPORTANT
- ALWAY keep track of what information the GPU needs. The GPU know nothing about the CPU world. I was constantly trying to hash a buffer with vector that I never set.

### Bug
- The current state is crashing.
- Tried to implement Pozzer's work, but the kernel crashes Unity.
- Commented the las two fors.
- A good thing is that the pivots usage is updating.

## Session 2024-11-11: Building hashed linked obstacles
- **Objective:** Hash the obstacles and describe the process

- What data needs to be sent?
- [ ] Amount of voxels, to module locations
- [ ] Voxel resolution, to scale back worl location
- [ ] Bounds extend, to know where are the limits of the volume
- [ ] The positions of the obstacles, to hash them
- [ ] A table to keep track of how many obstacle are in each voxel 
- [ ] A set to store the relationship between the hashed obstacles

- How many supporting data structures do we need to book-keep the obstacles?

Two data structures:
A table $$P$$ is the `_PivotTable`, storing:
- `x`: $$u$$ usage, how many obstacles are in that voxel at that time. The usage component start at `0`
- `y`: $$t$$ the top, or last obstacle that has been added to the stack. The `y` component is used as stack. Keeping track of the node that the boid can use to start traversing and computing the forces. The `x` starts at `-1`.

```C++
//                  voxel 0  voxel 1  voxel 2
_PivotTable<int3> { {u, t},  {u, t},  {u, t}, ... }  
```

A set $$O$$ is the `_HashedObstacleNodes`
- `x`: $$v$$ is location, where the obstacle has been hashed.
- `y`: $$n$$ is its the top node in the Stack. The first obstacle in the Stack will have a `-1`. Whereas, the second, will have the index to the first-in. This is a reference to the position within the same Set.

```C++
_HashedObstacleNodes<int2> { {v, n} // 0

                             { 0, -1 } // 1
                             { 0,  1 } // 2
                             { 2,  4 } // 3
                             { 2, -1 } // 4
                             { 0,  2 } // 5
}

// In this example, the obstacle as distributed as
 ----------- ---------
|v0 1, 2, 5 |v1       | 
 --------- -----------
|v2 3, 4    |v3       | 
 ----------- ---------
```

### Learnings
1. I was causing a race condition when traing to increment and assing some values to a buffer depending on the thread id. Had to include HLSL atomic oprations. `InterlockedAdd` and `InterlockedExchange`. When several parallel threads try to write to the same Buffer (which lives globally), the last will overwrite the work of all the others.
2. Remember to balance the thread group at every Dispatch accordingly to the size of the problem. I was dispatching the same number of thread groups when dealing with vixels than when dealing with obstacles.
3. As Buffer are heap memory allocations, in Unity `C#` they live as pointer, when passed between clases, they are passed by references not by value. If `class A` instantiate the BufferA, and then passes it to `class B`, the Buffer gets pass as reference, and `class B` does not need to deallocate that resourse. `class A` should handle the destruction of the buffer.
4. Buffer persist accross Dispatch calls. Only when `.SetData()` or `.Release()` are called, the buffers change.
